Steps on how to create a GitHub Page
- I first initialized a local Git repository and pushed the source code which consists of my updated html and css files as well as the jpg file to a public GitHub repository given to me (GitHub Classroom)
- Once the code was hosted, I navigated the Settings tab of the repository and selected the Pages menu from the sidebar. Under the Build and deployment section, I configured the source to "Deploy from a branch" selecting the line "main" branch and the root folder as the primary directory
- After saving these configurations, GitHub will automatically generate or assign a unique URL where the site is globally or publicly accessible

Key Takeaways
- This exercise provided a pivotal shift in how I view software development environments and design workflows. My most significant realization was that GitHub serves as the programming equivalent of Google Docs; it acts as a sophisticated collaborative space where multiple developers can contribute to and edit a project simultaneously without the risk of disrupting or destroying the primary source files. I am still amazed that I am able to learn how to clone repository, add, commit, and push a file into an existing repository that I have cloned.
